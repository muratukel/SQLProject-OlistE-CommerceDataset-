Welcome to the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist! This dataset contains valuable information about over 100,000 orders made at the Olist Store in Brazil from 2016 to 2018. These orders were placed on various marketplaces across the country. The dataset is rich in features, allowing you to explore orders from multiple dimensions, including order status, pricing, payment and shipping performance, customer locations, product attributes, and customer reviews.

In addition, we have also provided a geolocation dataset that maps Brazilian zip codes to latitude and longitude coordinates, making it even more valuable for analysis.

**Important Note**: This dataset is based on real commercial data, but it has been thoroughly anonymized to protect privacy. Any references to companies and partners mentioned in customer reviews have been replaced with the names of the great houses from Game of Thrones.

Feel free to explore and analyze this dataset for various insights, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further information.

Happy data analysis!

**Context**:
This dataset was generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. See more on our website: [www.olist.com](https://www.olist.com/)

After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.

I tried to introduce Olist a bit above, but I have placed the details about the dataset below. You can access it from the link.
